# college-info-scraper

Python program to web scrape info about a list of colleges I'm looking into from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and compile it into a csv file. It probably would have been faster to gather it by hand but oh well. It classifies each college as a safety, target, reach, or wildcard based on the SAT scores and acceptance rate. Program also gathers the name, website, location, city size, acceptance rate, expected net price for my family's finances, and reading and math SAT scores.
